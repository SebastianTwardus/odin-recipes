<h1>HTML Project: Food Recipes</h1>

<h2>This is a HTML project assigned from The Odin Project HTML Foundations Course</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A basic food recipe website incorporating all HTML knowledge gained from the Foundations course</p>
<strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong>
    <ul>   
        <li>Using basic HTML to structure a simple website with a few webpages</li>
        <li>Incorporating links, images (pictures & gifs), text styling, and lists</li> 
        <li>Using Git to track project changes</li>
    </ul>
<strong>What I learned:</strong>
    <p>
    Reinforced the concept of troubleshooting from the beginning. Had issue displaying images that I initially thought were due to new img formats (.webp & .avif) not rendered by my browser properly, but in reality the issue was simply the relative path file link was incorrect. In bash, "tree -r" command while in the project parent directory is a useful way to see entire project directory structure.
    </p>

    Subsequently, I learned before programming the project it beneficial to plan it out in advanced. Thinking about the website basic layout, features, and sketching a simple preview help with planning and structuring the general roadmap of the project. This let's you make progress before even worrying about how to translate it into code.

    Lastly, keep an open mind and try thinking of how to incorporate your knowledge in new ways to improve website design (think from the user's viewpoint: what do they expect a webpage to function like, what features help with navigation, etc.). Viewing other students' projects and other references will often demonstrate obvious ways you could have used your knowledge to implement a feature. As an example, including relative links back to the homepage or top of the current page. A simple concept that I did not think of when initially building the project since I limited design implementation to strictly what the assignment required, rather than being open-minded and looking to fully utilize what I learned.

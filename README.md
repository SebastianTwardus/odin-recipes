<h3>Revision 2023-12-30</h3>
<p>Added basic CSS to practice as per assignment</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A basic food recipe website incorporating all HTML knowledge gained from the Foundations course</p>
<strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Using basic HTML to structure a simple website with a few webpages</li>
    <li>Incorporating links, images, text styling, and lists</li>
    <li>Using Git to track project changes</li>
</ul>
<strong>What I learned:</strong>
<p>
    Reinforced the concept of troubleshooting from the beginning. Had issue displaying images that I initially thought were due to new img formats (.webp & .avif) not rendered by my browser properly, but in reality the issue was simply the relative path file link was incorrect. In bash, "tree -r" command while in the project parent directory is a useful way to see entire project directory structure.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequently, I learned before programming the project it is beneficial to plan it out in advanced. Thinking about the website basic layout, features, and sketching a simple preview help with planning and structuring the general roadmap of the project. This lets you make progress before even worrying about how to translate it into code.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, keep an open mind and try thinking of how to incorporate your knowledge in new ways to improve website design (think from the user's viewpoint: what do they expect a webpage to function like, what features help with navigation, etc.). Viewing other students' projects and other references will often demonstrate obvious ways you could have used your knowledge to implement a feature. As an example, including relative links back to the homepage or top of the current page. A simple concept that I did not think of when initially building the project since I limited design implementation to strictly what the assignment required, rather than being open-minded and looking to fully utilize what I learned.
